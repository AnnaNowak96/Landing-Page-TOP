# Landing-Page-TOP
The Odin Project. Goal is to create a landing page for a petsitter website.\
The page has to have logo on the left side, some links to "about" etc on the right side. An image, a text next to it and a button.  
Then in the center should be 4 options with 4 pictures. All should be centered.  
Below should be a quote with different style and background-color. Under that should be a last box with some encouraging text and button so the user could easly click on it. Lastly on the bottom of the page should be a footer.  
Here are screenshots:
