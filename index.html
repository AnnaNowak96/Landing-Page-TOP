        â€œDogs have given us their absolute all. We are the center of their universe. We are the focus of their love and faith and trust. 
            They serve us in return for scraps. It is without a doubt the best deal man has ever made."<p style="font-weight: 600; font-size: medium;"> ~Roger A. Caras~</p>
